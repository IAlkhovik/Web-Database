# Web-Database

This is an ongoing project for the development of the following skills: Spring Boot, HTML, JPA, Hibernate, and Bootstrap. This project is a website which connects to a local MySQL database which stores Person (id, name, age, occupation) objects. A user is able to add and remove a Person object from the database and search through the database by id, last name, or simply see all entries.

A pdf depicting the user screens is uploaded at SpringBoot Jpa PDF.pdf.

### Version Notes
