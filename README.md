# Web-Database

This is an ongoing project for the development of the following skills: Spring Boot, HTML, JPA, Hibernate, Thyemleaf, and Bootstrap. This project is a website which connects to a local MySQL database which stores Person (id, name, age, occupation) objects. A user is able to add and remove a Person object from the database and search through the database by id, last name, or simply see all entries.

A pdf depicting the user screens is uploaded at SpringBoot Jpa PDF.pdf.

### Version Notes

V1.0: User can add, remove, and search all entries freely.

V2.0: A user must login into an admin account (currently a default made one) to be able to delete entries from the database.
